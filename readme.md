Add a meta tag to your sites default/home page

Copy and paste the <meta> tag into your site's home page. It should go in the <head> section, before the first <body> section.

<meta name="msvalidate.01" content="09D54FE96561001336474549708FA0A9" />

To stay verified, don't remove the meta tag even after verification succeeds.
